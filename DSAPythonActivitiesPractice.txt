Problem I: Quadratic Equation Calculator
1. BEGIN
2. INPUT A, B, C
3. CALCULATE
d = sqrt(b*b-4*a*c)
x1 = (-b+d) / (2*a)
x2 = (-b-d) / (2*a)
4. Write x1, x2


Problem II: Simple Interest Calculator
SI = P X R X T
P = PRINCIPAL AMOUNT
R = INTEREST RATE
T = TIME (IN YEARS)
SAMPLE OUTPUT
ENTER PRINCIPAL AMOUNT: 5000
ENTER INTEREST RATE: 5
ENTER TIME (IN YEARS): 2
THE SIMPLE INTEREST IS: 50000


Problem III: Change in Velocity Calculator
v = u + at
U = INITIAL VELOCITY (m/s)
A = ACCELERATION (m/s^2)
T = TIME IN SECONDS
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
ENTER INITIAL VELOCITY: 10
ENTER ACCELERATION: 5
ENTER TIME (IN SECONDS): 2
THE FINAL VELOCITY OF THE OBJECT IS: 20.0 m/s


Problem IV: REVERSE NAME - TAKE AN INPUT OF A NAME AND REVERSE IT WITH SPACES
SAMPLE OUTPUT
INPUT FIRST NAME: MARC
INPUT LAST NAME: FAMERO
HELLO, FAMERO MARC!
